# Crafti Textures
A currated assortment of Crafti-compatible textures

This repo contains every "officially supported" Crafti texture pack, these packs have been converted from their vanilla formats for use with Crafti


Simply click on a folder with the name of the texture pack you want to use and copy the `crafti.ppm.tns` file to the `ndless` folder of you calculator and Crafti will automatically load it


## How to Install
To use a texture pack with Crafti, you have two options:  

a. Use Crafti's built-in texture loading system  
  - Go to the texture pack's folder and download the `crafti.ppm.tns` file  
  - Copy that file to your calculator's `ndless` folder

b. Rebuild Crafti from source (includes textures in binary and also lets you modify GUI and Particle textures)  
  - Go to the texture pack's folder and download the `textures` folder, then copy that file to Crafti's folder, replacing the pre-existing `textures` folder  
  - Navigate to that folder and run `make clean` and then run `make all`  
  - Go to Crafti's root directory and run `make clean` and then `make all`  
  - Copy the `crafti.tns` file from the `releases` folder to your calculator
