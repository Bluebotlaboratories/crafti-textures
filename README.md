# Crafti Textures
A currated assortment of Crafti-compatible textures

This repo contains every "officially supported" Crafti texture pack, these packs have been converted from their vanilla formats for use with Crafti


Simply click on a folder with the name of the texture pack you want to use and copy the `crafti.ppm.tns` file to the `ndless` folder of you calculator and Crafti will automatically load it


## How to Install
To use a texture pack with Crafti, you can:  

a. Go to the texture pack's folder and download the `crafti.ppm.tns` file, then copy that file to your calculator's `ndless` folder  
or  
b. Go to the texture pack's folder and download the `textures` folder, then copy that file to Crafti's folder, replacing the pre-existing `textures` folder and then build the textures and then build Crafti
